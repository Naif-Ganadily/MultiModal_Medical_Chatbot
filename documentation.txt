# Conda Environment Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create the Conda Environment
- Create a new environment named 'venv' with Python 3.10:
  conda create -n venv python=3.10

## Step 2: Activate the Environment
- Activate the created environment:
  conda activate venv

## Step 3: Install Required Packages
- Install packages via Conda:
  conda install numpy flask
- If some packages are only available via pip, install them as follows:
  pip install some-package

## Step 4: Export the Environment
- Once all necessary packages are installed, export the environment to a YAML file:
  conda env export > environment.yml

## Step 5: Commit the Environment File to Your Repository
- Add the environment file to your Git repository and commit:
  git add environment.yml
  git commit -m "Add Conda environment file"
  git push

## Step 6: Recreate Environment from the YAML File
- To recreate the environment on a different machine, use the YAML file:
  conda env create -f environment.yml

## Step 7: Activate the Newly Created Environment
- Activate the environment that was created from the YAML file:
  conda activate venv
